### Lesson 1 - Binary Search, Linked Lists and Complexity

QUESTION 1: Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.

## How to test

1.  binarySearch.py - contains binarySearch algorithm
2.  linearSearch.py - contains linearSearch algorithm implemented in python
3.  testcase.py - contains test cases
4.  Run testcase.py - it will import both searching methodes and check it and shows the result
